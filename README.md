# SentimentScope-Smart-Text-Sentiment-Analyzer
AI-powered sentiment analyzer built with Streamlit and Transformers to detect emotions in text data. Provides real-time insights, aspect-based analysis, and visual sentiment dashboards for smarter decision-making.

# Description
SentimentScope is an AI-powered web application that performs intelligent text sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Transformer models. It helps users analyze public opinions, reviews, and social media posts to gain real-time emotional insights. Built with Streamlit and Hugging Face Transformers, it provides an interactive dashboard for visualizing sentiment trends and aspect-based feedback analysis.

# Features
🔹 Real-time sentiment analysis using pre-trained Transformer models (BERT-based).
🔹 Upload text data (CSV) or analyze single comments interactively.
🔹 Visual analytics dashboard with sentiment breakdown and net sentiment score.
🔹 Aspect-based analysis (service, food, price, ambience, etc.).
🔹 91% accuracy using Stanford Sentiment Treebank Dataset.
🔹 Intuitive Streamlit UI with dark-themed design and data visualization using Matplotlib.

# Tech Stack

# Work Flow
1. Upload text data (CSV or manual entry).
2. Text is cleaned and processed using NLP techniques.
3. Transformer model classifies sentiments (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
4. Results are visualized through bar charts and sentiment metrics.
5. Aspect-based breakdown provides deeper feedback insights.
